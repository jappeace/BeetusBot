RENAME THIS FILE TO config.py TO MAKE BEETUSBOT WORK!

This is the config file for beetusbot
Things that change the behaviour of the bot should be placed here. For example passwords and the subreddit that is followed

you should try to avoid commiting passwords and such, because once commited it is hard to remove them from git (for most its impossible)
